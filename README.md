# cpp-text-button

A premade terminal "clickable" and "customizable" button made for C++ using the built-in library for C++. This project allows you to create interactive buttons in the terminal with customizable styles, colors, and behaviors.

## Features
- **Customizable Button Appearance**: You can easily set text color, background color, border styles, and hover effects.
- **Interactive**: The button reacts to mouse events, making it possible to click on it within the terminal.
- **Terminal-Compatible**: Designed to work in text-based terminals with full compatibility for ANSI escape sequences.

## Installation
No installation is required as the file has been compiled. Just clone and run application.exe to check. If you want to make any changes to the button, please
install MinGW from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ and link it to the enviroment PATH settings to compile

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o application.exe
```
